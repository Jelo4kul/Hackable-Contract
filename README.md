# Hackable-Contract
CarMarket is a marketplace where people interested in cars can buy directly from the company. 
The car company has its own tokens used in purchasing cars from the company. The first 100 users to patronize the company are given 1 Car token for free.
These tokens can then be used to purchase cars from the company.
Each user can only mint a token once from the CarToken's contract. Implying that a user can only purchase one car.
There is a bug however. A smart user can bypass this restriction to purchase more than one car.
Figure out how to purchase more than one car from the car company for free.
